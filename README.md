# TheMaze
*** It is really important to note that I removed the GoogleVR folder from the assests folder, if you could re-add it before running that would be appreciated as I could not upload such a large file to github. ***

This is a maze made using the given udacity prefabs supplied, all code given was not changed and all code added is my own code written with knowledge given by the Udacity course.

The first Scene to be loaded is called "Main"

Versions Used
